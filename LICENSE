The "copyleft" folks have made it rather complicated legally to use the Qt frameworks, but afaik this project is neither distributing Qt work nor any modifications or derivations.  It simply works with Qt's frameworks and the user of my code can dynamically or statically link against their libraries as they choose.  Therefore I "own" this code, and since I don't really believe in intellectual property at all, I'm distributing this code under the most permissibe license possible.  Unless otherwise specified at the top of an individual source code file, I hereby grant you a license for the remaining code in this repository as follows...
